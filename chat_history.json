We discussed about the computer network basics. And today... We'll deep dive into the OSI module. So. How many layers does the OSI module has? Anyone like to give a guess? कोई गेस करना चाहेगा? Someone says three. Someone says seven. OK. So there are seven layers in the OSI module. Good. So actually there are seven layers in the OSI model. The physical layer. The data link layer.

Alright. Let’s begin our session by catching up. Ahem. \n\nThe OSI model has seven layers. The TCP-IP model, on the other hand, has four layers. Okay? What exactly are computer networks?  Computer networks operate based on these two pillars: the OSI model and the TCP-IP layer.  It's important to note that the OSI model is just a theoretical framework. It was created as a lecture tool for understanding how different network protocols work, but the actual implementation is based on the TCP-IP protocol we use in our daily lives. \n\nThe IP layer has 128 bits. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address. These addresses are unique and assigned when you log in or connect your device to the internet.  Each time you do this, your IP address is of 128 bits long.",

This is a lecture in either English or Hindi.  Hello, you people are in 30th.  And you have a good background of... This is a lecture in either English or Hindi.  This is a lecture in either English or Hindi. What was the question? This is a lecture in either English or Hindi. It's a lecture in either Hindi or Hindi.  It's a lecture in either Hindi or Hindi. Uh... I didn't know that was the course. All right, so let me try to show this. This is a lecture in either Hindi or Hindi.  This is a lecture in either Hindi or Hindi. Sure. So, this is a... The title slide is that, you know, any one has any idea. I think we want to see whether we can start off here or not. And this will start soon. Bersungguh?  Ya, bersungguh. Perfect. So, what I am going to talk about today is basically the basic concepts of... There it is. The name of the lecture is pretty, why we call it jobs and why we call it jobs.  We will talk about all those things today. So I will be catching up on some principles, some practices, and... How effective it is in collobating. A different software politics, and how we basically develop and feel like it. I'm going to give a picture of this talk.  It's going to be on mobile.  Nowadays, some people send applications going on mobile. So it's slightly different than what we used to do. My name is Michael. And since I'm quite involved in the AI as well, I'm still learning. I'm doing a lot of work on our business.  I've been talking to my mom,  so I'm going to put a goal for L.C.T. So we'll see it on then how we begin. But, yeah, there's nothing wrong with developing some applications there. All right, so before we go, just a comment. This is a lecture in either English or Hindi.  This is a lecture in either English or Hindi. But why don't we develop something that may be... Or a problem. So problem could be a project and you are listening, you are going to do exams basically. Now let's follow on to the next lecture. And our goal basically is what's known as re-watching. All right. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. That's it. So I'll say that you all are part of my team, and then you all are welcome to reserve. It's long enough. And if you have any questions, answer me in the comments. So let us be patient and be humble and try to understand each other a little bit. Oh, it's so sad right now. Then who won? So what topics are you going to cover today? I'll start with the basic. I hope you've got some. What are the key concepts? And how to hold a glass... Here's one more. And the last five years have been very fast. And a lot of things got done. I'll look to you. And what do I mean? Properties or characteristics of DevOps, why they are so important and so useful. So how do we project? That's how we start and how do we project. It should be in the third year or in the next year or in the final year, all depends upon  everyone's choice and then how we apply the work principle and culture into the project. And once you apply that thing, one of the key benefits we achieve is what Chinese would be out there. Let us make a number of themes and then we plan it for the next lecture. What is it? Hmm. Achieved pretty well and then we can have a lot of push-mast sessions definitely. You can ask with this slide if something is there. Hello, my name is Arun.  I am from Chennai. Cool. Thank you very much. So firstly that the. Want to hear more? So. I'll show you one small line up. I don't know. Probably we can discuss that once upon a time. So... I don't know how much you must write that in Hindi, like... Сейчас мы запознёмся. So I do remember all. One of the words, and... Oh, wow. School then. And then... He's a bit trying to. Go along together but everything is different. There's not a single circuit which is all the same,  they are all in different actions at different times. and this one is coming coming coming. So these are. What we call on the graphics is called team work. I want to know a little bit about the teamwork that one is getting. That's it. Please talk in terms of software. It's what the son of Christ told me to do. Here I go, do you know what's up there? This book will be in some language. Nowadays we are going for a hardware code also that the infrastructure is also called. Bye. Some of this is also can be done in Goa, and they can be done in India, too. So. This is a simple word which I have written called... Thank you. This one is older than the other. Anyone can. What is teamwork and why it is important when you think? We'll be back. Ah. The main benefits of a theme work. Why should we focus on a theme work?  Why can't we do that?  That's why I can't think of a theme work. No one's talking. For nowadays, things are not as long as possible and won't first come to an end. So, let me give you a little bit of an idea. It's a blog, even though we live in a university system that we love. More or less something which basically is one of that. I was very, very young when I was a child and I never really did. Yes. Like, comment, share and subscribe. Vê se vem falando de um formulador.  Sim, o problema é que não tem gozo, velho. This is a lecture in either English or Hindi.  This is a lecture in either English or Hindi. So one word we use, very common, that whenever I get a new word, I do make the same mistake. Okay, yes. Go ahead. Is the possible is going to be spontaneously. What comes in the ocean is a... You see the capabilities of the person. As a software developer, I am going to discuss all these in our social media and what are the areas we are talking about. This is a lecture in either English or Hindi.  This is a lecture in either English or Hindi. Yeah. So I have a question for you. So let's say you are doing a D and you are on the roll out on D. So, why it is important that the human being is so critical to believe in something. My question, that's it, a couple of answers from you said, it doesn't matter if you lie. Let's talk about that. If you tell me if you are there, then one, two, three, one. So, what are the key benefits in your mind in fitting on this topic. Anyone else? Anyone can go inside and tell me what you think and you can chat something.  Are you ready for me to tell me your point? Is it teamwork? Should we do like this? Don't be shy. Just tell me anything in your mind.  It's very important that you should know. That's how a team works in a software. Yeah. Yes, I think you can mute. Yes, good. I can hear it now. Very good. What's the one benefit to life?  If I say can you give me two words? You'll also do it. What are you going to do? Yeah. That's a good one.  Yes. So, music was better, right? And you'll see a lot about it in a few minutes. Right, number two. Anyone else in the hall, just let them chance. One day work better. What else? I've got this here. Variety, so we can say multicast. Why?  Ok, Variety. So, let us see what is the speed of flow number 3. Let's have fun. Easy benefits and low costs.",

It's the path through which communication happens.  Correct. Communication between two computers or networking devices is done through the OSI model, right? Is it still used today? Thank you. Please review ➡️✔️✔️ Done. Now, we use the IPAIN discipline more often. So the OSI model is a sort of hypothetical model. Alright, and TCP IP is the actual model that we use.
